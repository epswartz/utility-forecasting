# Utility Forecasting for Duke University

Working with Dukeâ€™s Facilities Department, we have developed a tool which allows the cleaning and forecasting of utility usage data, for use in accurate budgeting and planning of new buildings.

## Installation/Usage

### Linux/Mac OS
0. You will need up-to-date python 3 and pip - see https://www.python.org/downloads/ (pip is typically included by default for Python 3.4+)
1. Clone (or download) this repo: `git clone https://github.com/epswartz/utility-forecasting.git`
2. Go into the directory and install the required packages: `cd utility-forecasting; pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `voila Forecasting_Tool.ipynb --VoilaConfiguration.file_whitelist="['.*\.csv']"`
4. A browser window should open displaying the tool, but if not, you can navigate to http://localhost:8866 yourself.

### Windows
0. You will need up-to-date python 3 and pip - see https://www.python.org/downloads/ (pip is typically included by default for Python 3.4+) make sure to check "Add Python to environment variables" - this checkbox is under Advanced Options.
1. Clone (or download) this repo: `git clone https://github.com/epswartz/utility-forecasting.git`
2. Go into the directory and install the required packages: `cd utility-forecasting; pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Unfortunately, voila does not work well with Windows. Instead of running voila, run: `python -m notebook Forecasting_Tool.ipynb` 
4. At the top of the notebook, click Kernel-> Restart & Run All. This may take a second to load, but you will see the tool appear at the bottom of the Jupyter notebook.

**Note:** Windows will sometimes download files as .xls, so rename to have the file extension be .csv which will show the data in the correct format

### Input Data Format
Input an excel file with first column labelled as `dt` representing the time/ date the data was recorded and the rest of the columns hold different building's data.

#### Available Date Formats
* `%m/%d/%y %I:%M %p`
* `%y-%m-%d`
* `%y/%m/%d`
* `%y-%m`
* `%y/%m`

### Sample Data
Sample data is provided in the `sample_data` folder. All of the sample data is raw (no cleaning has been done). To use this sample data upload it into the tool and select the matching frequency from the `Frequency of Input Data` dropdown. It's recommended to use aggregation at the daily level or higher for faster runtimes.
